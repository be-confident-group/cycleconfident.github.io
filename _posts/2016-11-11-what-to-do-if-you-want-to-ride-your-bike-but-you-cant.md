## Some days we just can’t ride our bikes. Maybe it's an injury, maybe the roads are icy, your bike's in need of repair or you are just resting for a big ride the next day. Whatever the reason, there are plenty of cycling related pastimes to keep you entertained.

## Doodle-a-bike

Doodling is not reserved for boring lessons in school or whilst taking a long phone call. Doodle away with your wildest imagination. Doodle a whacky bike, a bike with too many wheels, a bike that flies, a bike that rides on something that replaces the wheels or just a normal bike; you will be surprised how many people can’t draw a normal bike without one in front of them. ## Read our blogs

Well, you're reading this blog instead of cycling anyway, so why not read our other blogs too? Of course there are also plenty other sources of cycling related material that will quench your cycling thirst. ## Plan a route[![route](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4235390758_94ca93009a-300x290.jpg)](https://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4235390758_94ca93009a.jpg)

Perhaps you're planning your next cycling challenge or thinking of trying a new commuting route. Or maybe you just started cycling and don’t know the most favourable routes to destinations. Plan some routes in your off-bike time. Use a paper map, online resources or discussion with cycling buddies. ## Bike maintenance

Your bike needs your TLC or it'll start crying (or at least making funny noises) before throwing in the towel completely. Don’t be that person who rides around with a squeaky chain. Check out our two previous blogs on how to [breathe new life into your bike again](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/how-to-breathe-new-life-into-your-bike-again/) and the [must haves for home mechanics](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/must-haves-for-home-mechanics/). ## Visualisation

Close your eyes and think about where you could have been cycling. Is it a busy buzz around town, on rolling hills or gentle glide along the seaside? I guess you could call this day dreaming. Call it meditation and you might get away with it at work. ## Watch other people cycling

If you can’t do the visualisation thing then why not watch other people cycling? You can do that on the computer, TV, at a race or just standing on the street corner. ## Self reflection

What are you even doing not riding your bike? Do a serious evaluation what’s stopping you. If you are injured, think about how to avoid injuries; if the roads are icy, is it time to consider a move to a different country?; if your bike is broken, then I will refer you to point four of this blog; if you are resting for a big ride the next day, then read point three and start packing what you need for the ride. ![cat-and-bike](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cat-and-bike-300x225.jpg)Here’s a cat visualising cycling. What do you get up to when you are desperate to ride your bike but can’t? Let us know in the comments section.
