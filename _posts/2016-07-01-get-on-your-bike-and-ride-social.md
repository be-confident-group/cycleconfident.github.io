## Riding a bike is a great way to get around, it will improve your fitness, and can help your wallet too. It can also do wonders for your social life. Here are some great mass participation events with something for all types of cyclist.

## **Charity Rides**

There are lots of charity bike rides to choose from, with varying degrees of challenge to suit all abilities. Many are pitched at everyday cyclists, including the likes of the iconic [London to Brighton](https://www.bhf.org.uk/get-involved/events/london-to-brighton-bike-rides) ride organised by the British Heart Foundation. More demanding routes can take several days, including London to Paris, or further afield, cycling (part of) the [Great Wall of China](https://www.charitychallenge.com/challenge/58/Great-Wall-of-China-Cycle-Challenge).

There is an enormous number of sportive events to choose from in the UK, Europe and beyond. The biggest UK event with ambitions to become the London Marathon of cycling is [RideLondon](https://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/). Just like the marathon, demand far outstrips supply, so participants are either lucky in the ballot or take a charity place having pledged to raise a minimum amount. ## **Sky Ride**

Alongside sponsoring the team that propelled Wiggo and Froomey to Tour de France glory, Sky also supports grassroots cycling and mass participation events. They have a calendar of regular guided rides happening all over the country, alongside bigger traffic free events for all ages, and a network of informal social rides. [Check them out](http://www.goskyride.com/). ## **Something a little different**

Existing happily along[![](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6420709547_c653581d28-199x300.jpg)](https://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6420709547_c653581d28.jpg)side the bigger events there are a number of brilliantly quirky ways to enjoy your cycling. The “semi-organised” [Dunwich Dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunwich_Dynamo) sees riders setting off from London Fields as evening draws in and riding 120 miles to the Suffolk Coast. Many have a quick snooze on the beach before taking the coach back to London. The [Tweed Run](http://www.tweedrun.com/) is a “metropolitan bicycle ride with a bit of style”. Well dressed cyclists take to the streets and cycle past some of London's iconic landmarks stopping for a tea break and a picnic stop along the way, and ending with a bit of a jolly knees-up. The [London Nocturne](http://www.londonnocturne.com/) event includes elite level races, but also more unusual (if just as keenly contested) events for folding bikes, and penny farthings. Prefer to pedal like crazy without actually going anywhere? [Rollapaluza](http://www.rollapaluza.com/) events see cyclists going head to head over short sprints on stationary bikes in a party atmosphere with great music and cheering crowds. So whatever your ability, stamina, experience or nerve, get socialising on your bike and meet a whole world of like-minded folk.
