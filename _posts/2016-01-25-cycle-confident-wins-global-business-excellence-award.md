The company, which is London’s largest cycle training provider, was the winner in the ‘Outstanding Educational Service’ category at The Global Business Excellence Awards. Previous Global Business Excellence Award winners include The Royal Bank of Scotland, Vodafone, Transport for London, Thomas Cook and Bupa. The GBE awards has a large panel of independent expert judges who select winners according to strict criteria for each category and sector, focusing on financial results, innovation, customer, employee, investor and community benefits. ## Commenting on Cycle Confident, the chairman of the judges said:

“With more and more cyclists taking to the road in London, Cycle Confident is doing a brilliant job at providing road safety and bicycle mechanics training to youngsters, adults and older riders. It is also providing much-needed training for HGV and van drivers helping them to become more aware of cyclists on the road. Anything that is being done to make our roads safer is great news and Cycle Confident has to be commended for making a major contribution to road safety across the city.” Due to its high profile, the Global Business Excellence Awards attracts a wide range of entries from across the world, from large international PLCs and public sector organisations to dynamic and innovative SMEs. The winners all have one thing in common – they are truly outstanding at what they do. ## Upon receiving the award, Cycle Confident managing director, David Showell, said:

“This award recognises not only the tireless and outstanding work being done by everyone at Cycle Confident, but also the increasingly important role that education and training play in keeping cyclists safe on city roads. While we are hugely committed to the community focus wherever we work, we also have sights set firmly on the global scalability of the benefits we’re achieving. We are immensely proud to win this award which recognises the impact Cycle Confident is making on this sector.”
