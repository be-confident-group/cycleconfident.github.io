## ![water drops](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4325496505_51d2b1b821-201x300.jpg)We can debate all day whether or not we get more rain in the UK and the whole business of pessimism. Raindrops will fall, we will ride our bikes but it doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy the two together. There are many ways to make riding in the rain more enjoyable.

## Mudguards

They just make sense, they shield the bike from most road grit, you won’t get a trail of dirt up your back and the cyclist behind will silently thank you too. Some bikes are compatible with the traditional full length mudguards and if not, most bikes are catered for by clip on mudguards. Upside down your mudguards make two massive smiles and you'll be adding your own once you've seen the difference they make to riding in the rain! ## Enough of summer

There's no denying summer's over. But for the cyclist, the heat can be far from ideal. Cycling can be warm work and in many ways the cooler (and even wetter) months can be far better suited to it. And you'll find the cycle lanes and bike parking suddenly look a whole lot less crowded too. ## Waterproof / water resistant clothing

You don’t have to spend loads of money on technical clothing. Some sort of waterproof or water resistant jacket will go a long way and waterproof over-trousers are super practical too. To avoid boiling in your jacket, look for one with ventilation features like underarm zips or settle for a water resistant jacket that is more breathable. If it’s a great jacket, you will be glad of the rainy opportunities to wear it. ## Your bike will thank you for the wash

Bike maintenance and bike washing should be a regular occurence but if they aren't then a rain shower might help clean some of the grime off. (Don’t count on it though; a clean bike getting wet is going to attract dirt so perhaps just make sure your bike's very dirty in the first place!) ## Have food waiting for you at the end[![all gone](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5467425515_de8c373dc0-300x300.jpg)](https://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5467425515_de8c373dc0.jpg)

No matter how grim your rainy ride may be, looking forward to a warm shower and a filling meal at the end will make it all worthwhile. Have a homemade cottage pie waiting for you or detour to your local fish and chip shop on the last leg of your journey. So if we've not managed to convince you with all of the above, consider this: the majority of cyclists looking out at a rainy day may well ditch the bike and head for the tube or bus. Keep the resolve and get on your bike and we guarantee you a sense of achievement (not to mention the moral high ground) when you reach your destination!
