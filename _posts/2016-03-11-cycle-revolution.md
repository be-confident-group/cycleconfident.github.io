**Some inventions change the course of society, the internet perhaps being the most obvious these days. But right up there with the best of them would have to be the humble bicycle.**[Invented by Karl Drais in 1817](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_bicycle), the basic form of the bicycle has remained more or less unchanged since the addition of pneumatic tyres and a chain drive. Like the coat hanger and the bic biro, the enduring nature of the object is testament to the simple brilliance of its design. ## Cycle Revolution

No surprise then that the Design Museum is celebrating the bicycle in its current exhibition, [Cycle Revolution](https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/cycle-revolution), which runs till 30 June. The show allows you to get up close to some of the most iconic bikes ever ridden, including Team Sky’s Pinarellos from the 2015 Tour de France and The Lotus Type 108 ridden by Chris Boardman at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. You can also track the evolution of machines used to break the hour record with the bikes used by Eddy Merckx (1972), Francesco Moser (1984) and Sir Bradley Wiggins (2015) all on display. It’s not all about elite performance though, with a Brompton, a Breezer and even a Raleigh Chopper also on show. ## Get your own bike a health check

Cycle Confident will be outside the Design Museum on the weekends of 19-20 March and 9-10 April, offering a Dr Bike service. There will also be cycle training taster sessions, all free of charge. If your own bike is not quite in museum quality condition the Dr Bike sessions are an opportunity to get it checked over by an experienced bike mechanic, who will make any necessary minor adjustments or quick fixes there and then. If something a little more major is required they’ll explain what’s needed so that you can take your bike along to a local bike shop armed with all the information. Reserve your place [here](https://designmuseum.org/things-to-do/events/cycle-confident-dr-bike-sessions), or just drop in on the day. The cycle training taster sessions will last around half an hour and can be tailored to all ages and abilities. If you want to continue your training, and are a London resident, the chances are that [further free training](http://www.cycleconfident.com/sponsors/) is available at a time and place to suit you. ## Find Your London

The events on 19 and 20 March also form part of the Mayor of London’s [Find Your London](https://www.london.gov.uk/events/2016-03-18/find-your-london) festival, celebrating London’s outdoor spaces. There are lots of other bike related events taking place as part of the festival, including the chance to join a [cycling choir](https://www.london.gov.uk/events/2016-03-18/find-your-London/cycling-choir), or to [pedal-power a cinema](https://www.london.gov.uk/events/2016-03-18/find-your-London/pedal-powered-mini-cinema-electric-pedals). So whether you’re on a Pinarello or a Chopper, or something in between, pedal down to the Design Museum and come say hello.
