## ![Allen keys](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20494535929_93d06ab500-200x300.jpg)Regular checks and maintenance of your bike are highly recommended. And the good news is you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to do it yourself. Pick up the necessary skills at our [maintenance classes](http://www.cycleconfident.com/courses/maintenance/) and then all you will need is a set of tools. Here are some must have tools for basic maintenance jobs to keep your bike healthy.

## Allen key set

All the other tools will be jealous of a set of allen keys because they will be the clear favourite. Most components and accessories on your bike are held by bolts. Although the most used sizes are 4 and 5 mm, getting a set instead of buying one allen key at a time will be worth it for that one time when you need the 2 mm one. ## **Screw drivers (JIS)**

You probably refer to your cross head screwdriver as a Phillips screwdriver but it’s not necessarily the one you need. If you’ve cursed at the apparent incompatibility between your Phillips screwdriver and the limit screws on your Shimano derailleurs, then brace yourself for a mind blowing revelation. Shimano uses Japanese Industry Standard (JIS) screws on their derailleurs and Phillips screwdrivers don’t engage with these screws properly and “cam” out. Get yourself a JIS screwdriver and you will thank me for it.

Changing tyres should be one of the first maintenance skills you acquire and punctures strike when you are least prepared so have these at the ready. ## Track pump

If you are committed to changing tyres yourself at home then treat yourself to a track pump. Get one with a pressure gauge too while you're at it. ## Cable cutter

I’ve tried to cut brake and gear cables with a pair of cutting pliers before; we learn from experience. Use a good quality cable cutter for a clean cut in milliseconds and minimise the fraying on a new cable. ## Chain breaker

Changing the chain can [breathe new life into your bike](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/) and you will need a chain breaker. Here's a little tip: get an unused, round spoke and cut it to about 6 cm in length. Use a couple of pliers to bend hooks on both ends and you’ve got yourself a device to hold the loose ends of the chain together whilst you connect it back up. ## Chain oil and lubricants

Clean your bike often and reapply chain oil and lubricants where appropriate and your bike will love you for it (you'll know by the lack of squeaking, crunching noise from the drivetrain). ## Rags

Sometimes even the charity shops don’t want your old t-shirts. Worry not because your bike does. Use them to clean your bike, wipe off excess chain oil / lubricants, wipe clean the drivetrain or rims. I normally give up washing the rags after a couple of attempts; I’ve got a stack of old t-shirts queueing up to be sacrificed. ## Workstand

A workstand can be a bit of a luxury but it you are like me and want to avoid back pain at all cost then it becomes essential. You'll need to find a balance between cost, sturdiness and portability when shopping for a workstand but it'll change your whole experience of home mechanics. Do you have a tool at home that you rely on that is not on this list? Let us know in the comment section!
