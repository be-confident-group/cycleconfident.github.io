## Need a Christmas present idea that's perfect for the bike enthusiast who seems to have it all already? Look no further. Our Demystify Wheel Building course is the perfect gift!

![wheel-building](http://blog.cycleconfident.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Wheel-Building-300x200.jpg)Taking City &amp; Guilds standards and our teaching experience, we've developed this 2 day course to take students from minimal prior knowledge to being able to build a wheel from scratch. The aim is to give you the knowledge, resources and confidence to tackle selecting your own components, calculating spoke lengths and building your own wheel to the standard that is expected in the industry. ## On Day 1

Working in our accredited, fully equipped training workshop in Oval, you'll learn first about the materials and components. After this, you'll go on to rim, hub and frame compatibility, comparing lacing patterns before learning how to calculate spoke lengths for different hubs and rims for any wheel set. We end day 1 with lacing your spokes to hub and rim. ## On Day 2

Having dreamt about spokes all night you'll come in fresh to learn about truing and tensioning. You'll learn and then practice how to properly tension and pre stress a wheel to prevent damage and reduce problems down the line and you'll practice tensioning and making the wheel true to the tolerances expected across the bike industry. Finally, you'll stand back, marvel at your brilliance and return home basking in the glow of skills learnt having conquered the dark art of wheel building. ## Course Dates are Saturday and Sunday 18th-19th Feb.

Cost is £200 for a 2-day course. Here's the link to book: <http://www.cycleconfident.com/events/f9d17d86-3bf1-4635-af21-bab3a97bf2ce/>Merry Cycling!
